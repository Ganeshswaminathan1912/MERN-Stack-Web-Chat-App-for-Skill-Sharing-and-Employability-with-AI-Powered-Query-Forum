# MERN-Stack-Web-Chat-App-for-Skill-Sharing-and-Employability-with-AI-Powered-Query-Forum
Chat app and a Query forum that has chatgpt integrated.

It has a Query forum similar to any query forum but with chatgpt where chatgpt can answer your queries or any member from the community (if registered) could answer too, thereby increasing the accuracy of the answer.

It has a chat app where you can search for a particular skill and chat with the person and get guidance on how to improve their skills for better employability.

This chat app can run on the local network and can send messages from one device to another device.

It doesn't have any preloaded dataset, each user can register for new data, the database used here is MongoDB since we will  be handling big data.

For npm libraries used in front-end, back-end, and socket servers refer to the package.json in api directory, client directory and socket directory.
